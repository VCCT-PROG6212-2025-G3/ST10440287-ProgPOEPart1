# Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS)

An ASP.NET Core MVC web application called the Contract Monthly Claim System was created to speed up the submission, validation, and approval of monthly lecturer claims. In order to identify possible problems like long hours, duplicate submissions, or rate gaps, the system has an advanced automated verification engine that verifies claims against predetermined policies and calculates risk ratings ranging from 0 to 100. Lecturers can view thorough claim histories, submit claims with supporting documentation, and monitor their status in real-time. In order to make educated decisions on acceptance, rejection, or change requests, program coordinators and academic managers employ a complex approval workflow, evaluating claims using automated verification results. The HR module enables complete lecturer account management, including creating and editing profiles, activating or deactivating accounts, and maintaining hourly rate information. HR personnel can generate detailed CSV reports for approved claims, lecturer payments, monthly summaries, and complete lecturer directories, as well as create professional reports.
